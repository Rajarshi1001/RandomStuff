# flask_restapi

This is a Simple REST API made using packages:

* `Flask`
* `flask_RestFul`

Flask Restful provides various tools to develop RESTFUL APIs.
I have tested the API using REST Client extension provided by VSCode for multiple HTTP Requests.
The endpoints to the api are:

1. __/all_peeps__ = `returns all the students present in the database`
2. __/hall_peeps__ = has methods like `GET` `POST` `PUT` `DELETE` for inserting new members , updating their info or deleting them

That's all !!!!
